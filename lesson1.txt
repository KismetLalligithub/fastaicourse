dls = DataBlock(
	blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
	get_items=get_image_files, 
	splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42), 
	get_y=parent.label, 
	item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]
).dataLoader(path)


what does blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock) mean: 
	The first parameter is the input given to the model. 
	The second parameter is what the output could be, in a category of things. 

# Refining Data mediocre example

failed = verify_images(get_image_files(path))
failed.map(Path.unlink)
len(failed)

-> obviously get_image_files(path) returns all the images at the specified path. 
	then passed into verify_images which validates each of the images. 
	failed is a list of images that are not valid images or images at all. 
	then failed.map(Path.unlink), maps the Path.unlink function on the failed list. 

need to put aside a batch to test your own model, VERY IMPORTANT STEP

	splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42)
		
		valid_pct=0.2 means that we take 20% of the training dataset and use it to test the model.
		seed=42 means that each batch has 42 elements.
