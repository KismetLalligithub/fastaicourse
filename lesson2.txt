Step after getting data: 
	data cleaning

Precursor
Computer Vision
	object recoginition -> self-explanatory
	Where an object is -> object detection
	data aug -> for richer models 

nlp + computer vision through DP: 
	input images output english captions can be good but DP not that reliable for nlp (transformer diff)

cleaner = ImageClassifierCleaner(learner)
cleaner
^ data cleaning. 

Gathering Data
	search_images_ddg -> duckduckgo api to search for images. 
	bing -> can be used as well, sdk keys take forever. 
	img = search_images_ddg('grizzly bear')
	^ retreives images of grizzly bears from duckduckgo api.
